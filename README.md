 Welcome to the Annotation and Image Markup Project!
===================================================
Annotation and image markup  is an Open Source project that provides the functionalities to propose and create a standard means of adding information and knowledge to an image in a clinical environment, so that image content can be easily and automatically searched. 
AIM provides a solution to the following imaging challenges:
  * No agreed upon syntax for annotation and markup
  * No agreed upon semantics to describe annotations
  * No standard format (for example, DICOM, XML, HL7) for annotations and markup

The AIM project includes the following.
   * The AIM Model captures the descriptive information for an image with user-generated graphical symbols placed on the image into a single common information source.
   * The AIM Template Service is a web service application that makes it possible for you to upload (publish) and download AIM templates created using an AIM tool such as AIM Template Builder.
   * The AIM Template Builder is a Java application that allows you to build templates that are compatible with the AIM Model. Templates are a set of well-defined questions and answer choices that facilitate collecting information for a study. The AIM Template Builder has replaced the AIM Template Manager.
   * AIM on ClearCanvas Workstation is a reference implementation of the AIM Model. AIM on ClearCanvas Workstation demonstrat

It is written in C, C++, Visual C++, Java using other technologies.

The goal of Annotation and Image Markup Project is to develop a mechanism, for modeling, capturing, and serializing image annotation and markup data that can be adopted as a standard by the medical imaging community.
